This is the Assignment 1 for the Reproducible Research Course

Data file:
Activity Monitoring Data
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file
 and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)

Plots

R code:
- Read data from csv file 
- Remove NA 
- Calculate the sum
- Plot histogram for daily steps
- Calculate Mean Steps
- Calculate Median Steps
- Calculate Average daily activity pattern
- Plot Interval and Steps
- Calculate Maximim number of Steps
- Get Total NA in datasets
- Replace NA with the mean for that 5 mins interval
- Plot histogram total number of Steps per day with NA filled
- Calculate Mean Steps
- Calculate Median Steps
- compare between removed NA or filled NA with mean by plotting both cases
- Create new factor variable with weekday (0) and weekend (1)
- Plot the average steps for weekday and weekend
